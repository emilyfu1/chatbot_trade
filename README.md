# setting up an environment file:

In your local repository, you should store the ChatGPT API key (since it can't be shared publicly) and whatever relevant path names you have to the shared Dropbox. The formatting within the file should be identical to this:

```
KEY="put_key_here"
ENDPOINT="https://daz-openai-canada.openai.azure.com/"
DATA_FIGURES="C:\Users\\fuem\Dropbox (Bank of Canada)\TT_trade_relationships\data\statscan_trade"
DATA_CONCORDANCE="C:\Users\\fuem\Dropbox (Bank of Canada)\TT_trade_relationships\data\concordance"
```
